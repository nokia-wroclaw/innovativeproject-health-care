# Squad Health Care App

## The idea
Health-check is a clever way of measuring a team’s feelings: once a month, team members are asked to rate their satisfaction with certain areas, such as ‘Delivering value’ or ‘Teamwork’. Squad Health Care allows us to find problems when they are small and define proper solution. Additionally we are engaging all employees to be active in organization improvement topic. It is a massive amount of people who are thinking about “What has to change to create better work environment?”.

## The app
This app aims to provide all-in-one solution for _Health Check_ implementation in any workplace. The goal is to provide easy and safe way for managers to collect and analyze data from all employees.
